# A basic skeleton for Node.js REST API (express.js / MongoDB).

This is the basic skeleton for Node.js REST API. An app is sepated on logical layers. Therefore it can be easily scaled and used with different databases. The main purpose of the app is to serve as a back-end for SPA built with Angular, React, Vue etc.

## TODO

- add sanitization/validation middleware;
- add authentication with JWT;
- create generic controller middleware;
